# Solution to my recrutation task

Thank you for possibility to take part in your recruitment task.

## Usage

- To run task.js properly, you should add "--experimental-json-modules" flag, because I used [experimental json import module](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#json-modules) in my solution. 
- If you want run task.js without a special flag you can type `npm run task.js` which starts script placed in package.json where special flag is added. 
- I also changed export method to ES module in users2.js file to could properly import it.

## Old README

In file task.js add code for two tasks described in it. Results of both tasks should be shown after typing:

`node task.js`
